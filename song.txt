Living easy, living free
Season ticket on a one-way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I would rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too
I'm on the highway to hell
No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me round
Hey Satan, payed my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey Momma, look at me
I'm on my way to the promised land
I'm on the highway to hell
(Don't stop me)
And I'm going down, all the way down
I'm on the highway to hell

"Money Made"

Work work money made
Work work money made
Work work money made
Work work money made

Then went down to LA
They roped 'em in
She couldn't get away
Spending cash all about
The die was cast
There's no burning out amount of money made

Work work money made
Champagne life, high on display
Work work money made
Work work money made
You keep it up, you get it made
Work work money made

Can't bring me in to Hollywood
See you livin' it up
It feels mighty good
Recommendations all around
Come taste the sweet life
That's what it's all about
That money made

Work work money made
Champagne life, high on display
Work work money made
Work work money made
Keep it up, you make the grade
Work work money made

That money made
Hit the gas

That kind of life is good for her
Getting outta bed nearly half past four
Her swimming pool is the biggest about
So don't you call her 'cuz she ain't around
That money made

Oooh, money made
Oooh, that money made

Work work money made
Work work money made
Shake it baby shake it
Shake baby shake
Shake baby shake

Album: Back In Black
Play "You Shook Me All â€¦"
on Apple Music
She was a fast machine,
She kept her motor clean,
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen,

She had sightless eyes,
Telling me no lies,
Knockin' me out with those American thighs,

Taking more than her share,
Had me fighting for air,
She told me to come, but I was already there,

'Cause the walls started shaking,
The earth was quaking,
My mind was achin',
And we were makin' it and you...

Shook me all night long,
Yeah you, shook me all night long.

Working double time on the seduction line,
She was one of a kind,
She's just mine all mine,

Wanted no applause,
It's just another cause,
Made a meal out of me, and come back for more,

Had to cool me down,
To take another round,
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing

But the walls were shaking,
The earth was quaking,
My mind was aching,
And we were making it and you...

Shook me all night long,
Yeah you, shook me all night long,
Knocked me out, I said you
Shook me all night long,
Had me shaking and you,
Shook me all night long,
Well you shook me,
Well you shook me...

You really shook me and YOU!
Shook me all night long,
Aaaaahaaaahaaaah You...
Shook me all night long,
Yeah yeah you,
Shook me all night long,
You really got me and you,
Shook me all night long,
Yeah you shook me,
Yeah you shook me,
All night long.

Oi,

See me ride out of that sunset
On your color TV screen
Out for all that I can get
If you know what I mean
Women to the left of me
And women to the right
Ain't got no gun
Ain't got no knife
Don't you start no fight

Cause I'm T.N.T. I'm dynamite
T.N.T and I'll win that fight
T.N.T. I'm a power load
T.N.T. watch me explode

I'm dirty, mean and mighty unclean
I'm a wanted man
Public enemy number one
Understand?
So lock up your daughter
Lock up your wife
Lock up your back door
And run for your life
The man is back in town
So don't you mess around

Cause I'm T.N.T., I'm dynamite
T.N.T. and I'll win the fight
T.N.T. I'm a power load
T.N.T. watch me explode

T.N.T. oi, oi, oi
T.N.T. oi, oi, oi
T.N.T. oi, oi, oi
T.N.T. oi, oi, oi
T.N.T. oi
I'm dynamite (oi, oi)
T.N.T. oi
And I'll win the fight (oi, oi)
T.N.T. oi
I'm a power load (oi, oi)
T.N.T.
Watch me explode
